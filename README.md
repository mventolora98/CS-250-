# CS 250 - Sprint Review & Retrospective

Sprint Review and Retrospective
An outline of my Sprint Review and Retrospective for the finished project is given in this document. It emphasizes the main Scrum and Agile techniques used during the training, as well as the difficulties encountered and potential areas for development.

Sprint Review
I concentrated on deciphering customer requirements and turning them into useful software for the final project. I ensured a disciplined development process by using **user stories** to deconstruct complicated requirements into achievable chores. 

Key achievements during this sprint:
Implemented successfully [list any salient features].
Git and GitHub were used to ensure appropriate version control.
Held frequent stand-up meetings to talk about advancements and obstacles.

Retrospective
After considering the development process, I discovered that Agile techniques enhanced my workflow in the following areas:
**What worked well?** - Clear **user stories** improved task prioritization.
  Continuous feedback loops improved the project.
  Teamwork and version control were facilitated using Git collaboration.
**What could be improved?** - Better time management to allocate resources more effectively.
  Testing should be conducted more often in order to identify bugs early in the cycle.
  Enhancements have been made to the documentation to ensure maintainability.


Reflection on Essential Questions

1. How can I decipher user requirements and incorporate them into a program? What role does the creation of "user stories" play in this?It is necessary to comprehend the project requirements, examine possible use cases, and divide them into **actionable user stories** in order to interpret user demands. Clearly defining goals from the viewpoint of the user is one benefit of creating **user stories**.
Verifying that every feature corresponds with practical functionality.
Enabling developers to order jobs according to user requirements.

To illustrate this, I utilized user stories like this one in my final project: * "As a user, I want to be able to log in securely so that I can access my personalized dashboard."  
This method maintained user-centeredness and development focus.

2. How should I go about creating programs? Which Agile procedures would I like to use in my upcoming development projects?** I use the **Agile methodology** when developing software, specifically by using:
Dividing the project into manageable, tiny sprints is known as "iterative development."
Constant integration involves utilizing Git for version management and regularly committing code.
Participating in retrospectives and peer evaluations is an example of team collaboration.

In order to increase software reliability, I intend to implement: **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in the future.
For efficiency, use **automated deployment pipelines**.
Sprint planning should be more organized in order to lower technological debt.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
Being a good team player entails: - Effective communication to guarantee agreement on project objectives.
Engaging in active participation in conversations and code reviews.
Giving helpful criticism while remaining receptive to recommendations.
upholding **accountability** for duties and due dates.

By participating in conversations, resolving merge disputes, and using Agile best practices, I improved my teamwork throughout this course.

Conclusion
The finished project was enlightening and supported Scrum and Agile approaches in practical software development. I obtained real-world experience that will influence my future development methods by putting **user stories** into practice, iterating through sprints, and doing retrospectives.
